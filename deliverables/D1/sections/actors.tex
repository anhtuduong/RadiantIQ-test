\subsection{Roles functioning}
Each role provides specific and unique functionalities (that are mutually exclusive). Each user can have multiple roles assigned to them simultaneously, in a composite role system similar to the one used in Discord. We chose this model to easily separate functionalities and assign them to users modularily.
