\subsection{SWOT analysis}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Strengths:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item (1) Use of AI to generate basic information in the articles, with the supervision of admins. 
			\item (1) Use of AI to generate more advanced information from user’s customized necessities and weaknesses
			\item (2) Use a more fun and interactive approach in the education process
			\item (2) Learn by trying with minigames with immediate feedback or in a more standard way with articles
			\item (3) Possibility for experts to contribute with their own articles
			\item FLOSS Education Platform
		\end{itemize}
		
	\item \textbf{Weaknesses:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Developing effective mini-games’ experiences might be time consuming from a developer perspective
			\item Making fun and yet instructive experiences is hard
			\item Careful management of the AI generated information is needed
			\item Quality check on article uploaded must be implemented
			\item Costs of using LLMs
		\end{itemize}
		
	\item \textbf{Opportunities:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item (1) Using AI in education is an emerging idea that has not yet spread widely and can make this system unique
			\item (2) Various studies show the positive effect of interaction and hands-on experiences in the learning process
			\item Large demand of easy and complete ways to learn science
			\item (3) Lack of effective and proficient communication/cooperation/interaction between students and teachers which creates an ample improvement margin to be enhanced
		\end{itemize}
		
	\item \textbf{Threats:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Possible limitations of AI technologies from government entities
			\item Minigames must be entertaining to be successful
			\item Brilliant is a direct competitor (tho it does not currently use AI nor personalize its exercises and lectures)
			\item Hard to find funding
		\end{itemize}
