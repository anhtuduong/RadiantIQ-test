\section{Conclusion} \label{conclusion}

The project has made significant progress in generating ideas and documenting the Software Specification. This first milestone is meant to finalize Domain Analysis, Objectives, Actors, Function Requirement, Non-functional Requirements, Use cases, Context Diagram, Component Diagram and Class Diagram.

Some difficulties were encountered such as:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Lack of modeling tools to keep the consistency of the Software Specification across all documents and diagrams, for example while changing things in the Use case table we also want to see the updates to the diagram without redrawing them manually.
	\item Finding edge cases and all necessary pieces of the system that are required for its creation and proper function.
\end{itemize}

Moving forward, the focus will be on:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Reviewing these documents occasionally as we start an implementation to make sure everything stays aligned.
	\item Finding a modeling tool to keep the UML model up to date. The tool should support both directions of diagram-code transformation.
	\item Starting to choose and design the core components of the software.
\end{itemize}
